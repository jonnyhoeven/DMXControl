OPEN DMX Serial Controller interface
====================
This was a test project to develop interfaces for OPEN DMX usb nodes.
Sadly it was unstable and I opted for different hardware with their own buffer and dmx hold functionality.

It could be a nice framework to make your own usercontrols to control open dmx nodes.
